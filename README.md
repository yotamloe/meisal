interactive basketball installation for midburn

Components and Libraries:
-------------------------

1.  **ESP32**: The central microcontroller.
2.  **WS2812B LED strip and matrix**: You will need the Adafruit Neopixel library or the FastLED library to control these.
3.  **Photoelectric sensor**: Will act as an input to the ESP32.
4.  **YX6300 YX5300 UART serial MP3 player**: Will need software serial or UART for communication.

Steps:
------

1.  **Initialize Devices**:
    
    *   Initialize the LED strip and matrix.
    *   Set up the photoelectric sensor as an input.
    *   Set up software serial or UART for the MP3 player.
2.  **Waiting for Start Signal**:
    
    *   Continuously check for a start signal.
    *   Once detected, begin the game countdown.
3.  **Game Countdown**:
    
    *   Using the LED matrix, display countdown from 10 to 0.
    *   Simultaneously, start the LED strip effect (e.g., pulsing lights).
    *   Play the game music using the MP3 player.
4.  **Game Logic**:
    
    *   Continuously check for a signal from the photoelectric sensor.
    *   If the signal is detected before the countdown reaches zero:
        *   Play a random sound from the MP3 player.
        *   Turn the LED strip green.
    *   If the countdown reaches zero before a signal is detected:
        *   Play the buzzer sound from the MP3 player.
        *   Turn the LED strip red.
5.  **End of Game**:
    
    *   Reset the system and return to the waiting state.

Sample Pseudocode:
------------------
```c++
setup() {
  initialize LED strip and matrix;
  set up photoelectric sensor;
  set up MP3 player;
}

loop() {
  if (start_signal_detected) {
    play_game();
  }
}

play_game() {
  start_countdown();
  start_LED_strip_effect();
  play_game_music();
  
  while (time_remaining &gt; 0) {
    if (basket_scored) {
      play_random_sound();
      LED_strip_green();
      return;
    }
    delay(1);  // wait for 1 millisecond
    time_remaining -= 1;
  }
  
  play_buzzer_sound();
  LED_strip_red();
}
```
